# Visualizing-Climate-Change

Visualizing Climate Change Project
------------------------------------
This project simulates climate change data for CO₂ concentration and
global temperature anomalies from 1960 to 2020.
It performs various analyses and visualizations including:
- Line plots for CO₂ and temperature trends
- Dual axis plots for combined visualization
- Correlation analysis and heatmap
- Calculation of rate of change (yearly differences)
- Moving average smoothing
- Polynomial regression to show trends
- Cluster analysis (using KMeans) on normalized data

Requirements:
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
